- ✖️ Transferring history list with re-try button.
- ✖️ sftp FileSystem with custom VirtualFile.
- ➖️ More operations in file view port: delete, copy, paste, etc...

## Known Issues
- Make sure the double-clicked remote file is not in the downloading queue.
- Folder uploading progress(Task.Backgroundable) calculation error.

## Nuts-pain
```java
ConnectionBuilder connectionBuilder = RemoteCredentialsUtil.connectionBuilder(data, this.project);
SftpChannel sftpChannel = connectionBuilder.openSftpChannel();
sftpChannel.uploadFileOrDir(local, remote, ""); // -> throws some exceptions because the remote variable has been appended a "/" at its tail
```

## Enhancements
- UI needs obey [IntelliJ Platform UI Guidelines](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/)
- Uploading and downloading performance test.
- English JavaDoc and comments maybe?
- More comfortable usage of SSHChannel?
